Examples: 
<h3>“守株待兔“</h3>
<br>“守株待兔“ directly translates to “To Stand by a Tree Stump Waiting for a Hare”. One of the most famous and loved Chinese idiom stories. 
The idiom tells the story of a farmer who rises early in the morning everyday to work in his field. One day, he suddenly saw a hare running toward and hit its head on a tree. He said happily: “Great! I will have a delicious dinner.” From that day on, he sits under the tree waiting for hares to keep hitting on the tree. But the field had slowly become a mess and all his crops had died after he spent his days lazing away at the tree. No hares ever came by and hit the tree.  Every Chinese kid is introduced to this story at a young age to motivate them to work hard to gain what they want.
